Ctf2Unity is a tool that converts Clickteam Fusion 2.5 Projects into Unity Projects.

Ctf2Unity+ is continuing from where the original dev stopped at.

As of right now Ctf2Unity+ uses Unity 2020.2.2f1.

We would like to fully finish it and then add support to older Unity versions (Unity 2017 to Unity 2018).

It's really unfinished, almost all the events and actions are not done yet.

We need more developers, so if you want to help, contact me.
